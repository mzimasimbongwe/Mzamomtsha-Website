We have used list of mark up languages below to create our websites
HTML
CSS
BOOTSCRAP
JAVASCRIPT

## Code Conversion
We have used Html

Html tags and descriptions 
!--...-->	Represents a comment in the HTML code. Comments are not displayed on a web page (only in the source code).	 
<!doctype>	Represents the document type. (HTML5 uses <!doctype html>)	 
<a>	Represents a hyperlink (the link that a user clicks on to go to another web page or document).	 
<abbr>	Represents an abbreviation	 
<address>	Represents an address element	 
<area>	Represents an area inside an image map. Used with the <map> and <img> elements.	 
<article>	Represents an article. This HTML tag was introduced in HTML5.	NEW
<aside>	Represents content aside from the page content. This HTML element is new in HTML5.
  
We also used Css
What font type and size does <h1>Introduction</h1> generate? Answer: Some default from the browser (HTML tells what browser how) Early HTML - Override defaults with attributes <table border="2" bordercolor="black"> Style sheets were added to address this: Specify style to use rather than browser default Not have to code styling on every element

We separated css files to html
Content (what to display) is in HTML files Formatting information (how to display it) is in separate style sheets (.css files). Use an element attribute named class to link  (e.g. <span class="test">) Result: define style information once, use in many places Consider can you make all the text in the app slightly bigger?  Or purple is our new company color.

Some Css that we used was position: static; position: relative; position: fixed; (default) - Position in document flow Position relative to default position top, right, bottom via , and left properties Position to a fixed location on the screen top, right, bottom , and via left properties position: absolute; Position relative to ancestor top, right, bottom absolute , and  element via left properties

On bostrap we applied Grid system layout
Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works:  Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding.  Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.  Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.  Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts. LESS mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts.  Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows.  Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.
